    "# About the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Standardized testing, particularly the SATs, holds significant weight in the American education system, serving as a crucial determinant for college admissions. With each of its three sections—reading, math, and writing—carrying a maximum score of 800 points, the SATs play a pivotal role in assessing students' literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. Analyzing the performance of schools on these tests is paramount for a multitude of stakeholders, including policymakers, educators, researchers, governmental bodies, and parents deliberating on their children's educational paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "For this project, we have been provided with a dataset named schools.csv, which encapsulates valuable insights into New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis, containing crucial metrics related to SAT scores and other relevant factors. By delving into this dataset, we aim to unravel patterns, trends, and performance metrics of NYC public schools in SAT examinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis revolves around three central questions concerning NYC public school SAT performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n",
    "2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n",
    "3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n",
    "\n",
    "Through rigorous examination and data-driven insights, we endeavor to shed light on these inquiries, providing valuable insights for stakeholders invested in understanding and improving NYC public school education.\n",
